About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) have been around for many decades
and serve as the _de facto_ standard for performance-portable and numerically
robust implementation of essential linear algebra functionality.
Originally, they were written in Fortran, and later furnished with a C API
(CBLAS).

The objective of BLAS++ is to provide a convenient, performance oriented API
for development in the C++ language, that, for the most part,
preserves established conventions, while, at the same time, takes advantages
of modern C++ features, such as: namespaces, templates, exceptions, etc.

BLAS++ is part of the SLATE project
([Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale](http://icl.utk.edu/slate/)),
which is funded by the [Department of Energy](https://energy.gov)
as part of its [Exascale Computing Initiative](https://exascaleproject.org)
(ECP).
Closely related to BLAS++ is the
[LAPACK++](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/lapackpp) project,
which provides a C++ API for LAPACK.
